### 2015-01-07 09:00, just setting up my jrnl 


 

### 2015-01-08 09:00, struggling to get the imagepickercontroller to take up the full screen, and have buttons sit on top a la snapchat. 

Realized my overlayView is actually not doing anything. Frustrated struggling to focus at the office and waffling about how polished this code wireframe needs to be.

 

### 2015-01-09 09:00, making a website from scratch is so painful. 

I hate CSS. I hate HTML. I hate Jekyll. I have a love-hate relationship with Heroku. I kind of like Rack. I hate domains and CNAMEs. I should have just made a website that's a huge image with image maps.

### 2015-01-11 09:00, test 


 

### 2015-01-11 09:00, cranked out most of RVINAS at Variety. 

Pretty happy with it, but also scared / embarrassed of reactions. Dread having to explain to people that it's fiction. Dread realizing that my fondness for it is actually just a touch of mania, that the design actually sucks, etc. Guy next to me was telling his friend about his successful zine. Jealous.

 

### 2015-01-12 09:00, started a new project in xcode to try and distill this full-screen camera problem for l8r. 

Wonder if this is a classic rookie thing : creating a new project every time I run into a tricky problem. Got waylaid with a Storyboard thing, but quickly (15 mins) remembered the solution from last time: when creating a new view, make sure to link up the file's owner to the View Controller, otherwise everything will not work.

 

### 2015-01-12 09:00, side note: jrnl is pissing me off bc I have to escape every special character. 


 

### 2015-01-13 09:00, SO is terrible in a lot of ways but I would be lost without it. 

Banged my head against the wall trying to figure out why my UIButton looked weird when I gave it an image. Turns out I have to set it to "Custom" from "Sysem" in IB. IB is terrible but increasingly seems like a terrible necessity.

 

### 2015-01-14 09:00, all this spinup stuff - the website, video demos, etc. 

- is starting to pay off as I can more efficiently share what I'm working on with other people.

 

### 2015-01-24 09:00, Back on the grind, coding up the pageviewcontroller. 

brutal, long, slow, work.

 

### 2015-01-24 09:00, sendsubviewtoback, bringsubviewtoback. 

#why

 

### 2015-01-25 09:00, have started to make use of a very simple, very useful pattern, which is "if thing exists, remove it." this lets me reuse my scene-setup code. 


 

### 2015-01-27 09:00, saving to disk was almost - dare i say it - painless. 

Weird casting thing where I had to call the path an NSString and not a String, but easily solved via lord overflow.

 

February

### 2015-02-02 09:00, struggling to handle notifications that passed but were never fired. 

ie., l8r says A photo is ready for you but you are afk. Came up with a diabolical scheme to use the timeInterval property to make them recurring at ridiculously long intervals (5 years) and manually expire them

 

### 2015-02-03 09:00, rewriting a lot of code for two separate view controllers. 

A long overdue breakthrough will be learning how to create new files for shared functions... I guess it would be a new class? But what is that class inheriting from? Or its a struct maybe\? Duno.
jrnl today: rewriting a lot of code for two separate view controllers. A long overdue breakthrough will be learning how to create new files for shared functions... I guess it would be a new class? But what is that class inheriting from? Or its a struct maybe? Duno.

 

### 2015-02-03 09:00, just renamed a variable ever with edit all in scope i am a god 


 

### 2015-02-03 09:00, gesture recognizer wasn't working and i immediately troubleshot it by enabling user interaction on my UIImageView I am on fire 


 

### 2015-02-03 20:45, jersey shore 3 > jersey shore 1 > jersey shore 2 


 

### 2015-02-09 09:00, distracted today. 

catching up on emails. chess is a vice

 

### 2015-02-14 15:49, going back and updating the kanban board for l8r tasks. 

time to go micro. started diving into core data. at first glance it seems simple. won't know for sure I'm doing it right until I show the images. Writing NSData to console logs was fun. Feel reenergized. Starting from scratch, but not.

 

### 2015-02-14 15:52, designing a bit more. 

using pixate. the secret is this. building once takes about as much time as designing once. but designing many times is faster than building many times.

 

### 2015-02-15 15:21, in retrospect core data is the obvious starting point. 

starting with notification center and trying to hack my way into a data model was a bad mistake.

 

### 2015-02-15 17:10, printing NSData to the console is a good way to feel like you're in the matrix. 

Ah yes, that image appears to be rendering nicely.

 

### 2015-02-18 18:33, finally learned what MARK does 


 

### 2015-02-18 21:05, make a g-spot joke about touch up inside 


 

March

### 2015-03-02 12:34, a new kind of frustration. 

trying to add text to image and save with UIGraphicsBeginContext etc. App keeps crashing by disconnecting. No error messages at all

 

### 2015-03-02 14:00, viewDidAppear is not viewWillAppear
