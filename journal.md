### 2015-01-07 09:00, just setting up my jrnl 


 

### 2015-01-08 09:00, struggling to get the imagepickercontroller to take up the full screen, and have buttons sit on top a la snapchat. 

Realized my overlayView is actually not doing anything. Frustrated struggling to focus at the office and waffling about how polished this code wireframe needs to be.

 

### 2015-01-09 09:00, making a website from scratch is so painful. 

I hate CSS. I hate HTML. I hate Jekyll. I have a love-hate relationship with Heroku. I kind of like Rack. I hate domains and CNAMEs. I should have just made a website that's a huge image with image maps.

### 2015-01-11 09:00, test 


 

### 2015-01-11 09:00, cranked out most of RVINAS at Variety. 

Pretty happy with it, but also scared / embarrassed of reactions. Dread having to explain to people that it's fiction. Dread realizing that my fondness for it is actually just a touch of mania, that the design actually sucks, etc. Guy next to me was telling his friend about his successful zine. Jealous.

 

### 2015-01-12 09:00, started a new project in xcode to try and distill this full-screen camera problem for l8r. 

Wonder if this is a classic rookie thing : creating a new project every time I run into a tricky problem. Got waylaid with a Storyboard thing, but quickly (15 mins) remembered the solution from last time: when creating a new view, make sure to link up the file's owner to the View Controller, otherwise everything will not work.

 

### 2015-01-12 09:00, side note: jrnl is pissing me off bc I have to escape every special character. 


 

### 2015-01-13 09:00, SO is terrible in a lot of ways but I would be lost without it. 

Banged my head against the wall trying to figure out why my UIButton looked weird when I gave it an image. Turns out I have to set it to "Custom" from "Sysem" in IB. IB is terrible but increasingly seems like a terrible necessity.

 

### 2015-01-14 09:00, all this spinup stuff - the website, video demos, etc. 

- is starting to pay off as I can more efficiently share what I'm working on with other people.

 

### 2015-01-24 09:00, Back on the grind, coding up the pageviewcontroller. 

brutal, long, slow, work.

 

### 2015-01-24 09:00, sendsubviewtoback, bringsubviewtoback. 

 

### 2015-01-25 09:00, have started to make use of a very simple, very useful pattern, which is "if thing exists, remove it." this lets me reuse my scene-setup code. 


 

### 2015-01-27 09:00, saving to disk was almost - dare i say it - painless. 

Weird casting thing where I had to call the path an NSString and not a String, but easily solved via lord overflow.
