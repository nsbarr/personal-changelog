### 2015-01-07 09:00, just setting up my jrnl 


### 2015-01-08 09:00, struggling to get the imagepickercontroller to take up the full screen, and have buttons sit on top a la snapchat. 

Realized my overlayView is actually not doing anything. Frustrated struggling to focus at the office and waffling about how polished this code wireframe needs to be.

 

### 2015-01-09 09:00, making a website from scratch is so painful. 

I hate CSS. I hate HTML. I hate Jekyll. I have a love-hate relationship with Heroku. I kind of like Rack. I hate domains and CNAMEs. I should have just made a website that's a huge image with image maps.
 

### 2015-01-11 09:00, cranked out most of RVINAS at Variety. 

Pretty happy with it, but also scared / embarrassed of reactions. Dread having to explain to people that it's fiction. Dread realizing that my fondness for it is actually just a touch of mania, that the design actually sucks, etc. Guy next to me was telling his friend about his successful zine. Jealous.

 

### 2015-01-12 09:00, started a new project in xcode to try and distill this full-screen camera problem for l8r. 

Wonder if this is a classic rookie thing : creating a new project every time I run into a tricky problem. Got waylaid with a Storyboard thing, but quickly (15 mins) remembered the solution from last time: when creating a new view, make sure to link up the file's owner to the View Controller, otherwise everything will not work.


### 2015-01-12 09:00, side note: jrnl is pissing me off bc I have to escape every special character.
